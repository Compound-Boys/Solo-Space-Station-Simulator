"""
Station layout modules live here, one file per map (e.g. donut.py).

Each map module is expected to expose this interface so new maps can be
added without touching the game code that consumes them:

    SHIP_MAP             -- dict of "x,y" -> {"name", "desc", ["locked"]}
    SPECIAL_ROOM_TILES    -- dict of "x,y" -> special room name (door tiles)
    SPECIAL_ROOM_HALLWAY  -- dict of "x,y" -> (x, y) hallway tile in front of it
    STARTING_LOCATION     -- dict {"x": int, "y": int} where a new game begins
    get_available_directions(x, y) -- dict of north/south/east/west bools
    render_map_text()     -- str, a readable text version of the map
